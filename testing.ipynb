In object-oriented programming (OOP), we solve \\\\ncomplex problems by dividing them into objects. \\\\nTo work with objects, we need to perform the following activities: \\\\n\\uf0d8 create a class \\\\n\\uf0d8 create objects from the class \\\\n \\\\nC# Class \\\\n\\uf0d8 Before we learn about objects, we need to understand the working of classes.  \\\\n\\uf0d8 Class is the blueprint for the object. \\\\n\\uf0d8 For Example: We can think of the class as a sketch (prototype / house plan) of a house. It \\\\ncontains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. We can build a house based \\\\non these descriptions. House is the object. \\\\n\\uf0d8 Like many houses can be made from the sketch, we can create many objects from a class. \\\\n \\\\nCreate a class in C# \\\\n\\uf0d8 We use the class keyword to create an object. For example, \\\\nclass Account  \\\\n{ \\\\n       \\\\n} \\\\nHere, we have created a class named Account. \\\\n\\uf0d8 A class can contain \\\\no fields - variables to store data(instance variables) \\\\no methods - functions to perform specific tasks (instance methods) \\\\n\\uf0d8 Let's see an example, \\\\nclass Account  \\\\n{ \\\\n    //fields  \\\\n    int accno; \\\\n    string name; \\\\n    double balance; \\\\n \\\\n    //methods  \\\\n    public void showBalance() \\\\n    { \\\\n \\\\n    } \\\\n} \\\\nIn the above example, accno, name, balance are called as\"),\n",

In C#, fields and methods inside a class are called members of a class . \\\\n \\\\nC# Objects \\\\n\\uf0d8 An object is an instance of a class. Suppose we have a class  “Account” and John Account, \\\\nGrace Account, Martin Account are object of the class “Account”.

And,  \\\\nobj is the name or reference of the object. \\\\n \\\\n\\uf0d8 Now, let us create an object from the Account class. \\\\n     Account obj = new Account(); \\\\n \\\\nNow, the obj object can access the fields and methods of the Account class. \\\\n \\\\nAccess Class Members using Object \\\\n\\uf0d8 We use the name or reference of object along with the .(dot) operator to access members \\\\nof a class. For example, \\\\n  Account account = new Account(); \\\\n        \\\\n  //Accessing fields  \\\\n       account.balance = 10000; \\\\n  \\\\n //Accessing method  \\\\n account.showBalance(); \\\\n \\\\n\\uf0d8 Example Program:-  Simple Bank Account Class with Fields and Methods \\\\nusing System; \\\\nclass Account  \\\\n{ \\\\n    //fields  \\\\n    int accno; \\\\n    string name; \\\\n    double balance; \\\\n \\\\n    //methods  \\\\n    public double showBalance() \\\\n    { \\\\n        return balance; \\\\n    } \\\\n\"),\n",
