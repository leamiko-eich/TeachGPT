In object-oriented programming (OOP), we solve \\\\ncomplex problems by dividing them into objects. \\\\nTo work with objects, we need to perform the following activities: \\\\n\\uf0d8 create a class \\\\n\\uf0d8 create objects from the class \\\\n \\\\nC# Class \\\\n\\uf0d8 Before we learn about objects, we need to understand the working of classes.  \\\\n\\uf0d8 Class is the blueprint for the object. \\\\n\\uf0d8 For Example: We can think of the class as a sketch (prototype / house plan) of a house. It \\\\ncontains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. We can build a house based \\\\non these descriptions. House is the object. \\\\n\\uf0d8 Like many houses can be made from the sketch, we can create many objects from a class. \\\\n \\\\nCreate a class in C# \\\\n\\uf0d8 We use the class keyword to create an object. For example, \\\\nclass Account  \\\\n{ \\\\n       \\\\n} \\\\nHere, we have created a class named Account. \\\\n\\uf0d8 A class can contain \\\\no fields - variables to store data(instance variables) \\\\no methods - functions to perform specific tasks (instance methods) \\\\n\\uf0d8 Let's see an example, \\\\nclass Account  \\\\n{ \\\\n    //fields  \\\\n    int accno; \\\\n    string name; \\\\n    double balance; \\\\n \\\\n    //methods  \\\\n    public void showBalance() \\\\n    { \\\\n \\\\n    } \\\\n} \\\\nIn the above example, accno, name, balance are called as\"),\n",

In C#, fields and methods inside a class are called members of a class . \\\\n \\\\nC# Objects \\\\n\\uf0d8 An object is an instance of a class. Suppose we have a class  “Account” and John Account, \\\\nGrace Account, Martin Account are object of the class “Account”.

And,  \\\\nobj is the name or reference of the object. \\\\n \\\\n\\uf0d8 Now, let us create an object from the Account class. \\\\n     Account obj = new Account(); \\\\n \\\\nNow, the obj object can access the fields and methods of the Account class. \\\\n \\\\nAccess Class Members using Object \\\\n\\uf0d8 We use the name or reference of object along with the .(dot) operator to access members \\\\nof a class. For example, \\\\n  Account account = new Account(); \\\\n        \\\\n  //Accessing fields  \\\\n       account.balance = 10000; \\\\n  \\\\n //Accessing method  \\\\n account.showBalance(); \\\\n \\\\n\\uf0d8 Example Program:-  Simple Bank Account Class with Fields and Methods \\\\nusing System; \\\\nclass Account  \\\\n{ \\\\n    //fields  \\\\n    int accno; \\\\n    string name; \\\\n    double balance; \\\\n \\\\n    //methods  \\\\n    public double showBalance() \\\\n    { \\\\n        return balance; \\\\n    } \\\\n\"),\n",

Jims John Wessley \\n\\nSatellites – Classification and Applications \\n\\nOUTLINE\\n\\nIntroduction\\nTypes of Satellites \\n\\n1. INTRODUCTION \\n\\nA satellite is a moon, planet or machine that orbits a planet or star\\nExample, Earth is a satellite because it orbits the sun, moon is a satellite because it orbits Earth\\n\"satellite\" refers to a machine that is launched into space and moves around Earth or another body in space\\n\\n1. INTRODUCTION \\n\\n1. INTRODUCTION \\n\\nThe bird\\'s-eye view that satellites have allows them to see large areas of Earth at one time\\nAbility to collect more data, more quickly, than instruments on the ground\\n\\n1. INTRODUCTION \\n\\nSatellites can see space better than telescopes at Earth\\'s surface\\n\\nSatellites fly above the clouds, dust and molecules in the atmosphere that can block the view from ground level\\n\\n1. INTRODUCTION \\n\\nSatellites can be classified by their function -launched into space to do a specific job\\nSatellite that is launched to monitor cloud patterns for a weather station will be different than a satellite launched to send television signals\\n\\n2.

TYPES OF SATELLITES \\n\\nAstronomy Satellites\\n\\n\\nAn astronomy satellite is a really big\\xa0telescope\\xa0floating in space \\nBecause it is in orbit above the Earth, Astronomy satellites can \"see\" into space up to ten times better than a telescope of similar strength on Earth\\n\\n2. TYPES OF SATELLITES \\n\\nAstronomy Satellites\\n\\n\\nHubble Telescope\\n\\nASTROSAT \\n\\n2. TYPES OF SATELLITES \\n\\nAstronomy Satellites\\n\\n\\nApplications :\\nUsed to make star maps\\nUsed to study mysterious phenomena such as black holes\\nUsed to take pictures of the planets in the solar system\\nUsed to make maps of different planetary surfaces\\n\\n2. TYPES OF SATELLITES \\n\\n2. Atmospheric Studies \\n\\nAtmospheric studies satellites were some of the very first satellites launched into space\\nThey are low Earth orbits so that they can study the Earth\\'s\\xa0atmosphere\\n\\n2.

Communication Satellites \\n\\nRadio, television, and telephone transmissions anywhere in the world\\nBefore satellites, transmissions were difficult or impossible at long distances\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2. TYPES OF SATELLITES \\n\\n3. Communication Satellites \\n\\nThe signals, which travel in straight lines, could not bend around the round Earth to reach a destination far away\\nBecause satellites are in orbit, the signals can be sent instantaneously\\n\\n2. TYPES OF SATELLITES \\n\\n3. Communication Satellites \\n\\nCommunication by bouncing signals from the Earth back to another location on the Earth\\nTransponders\\xa0for receiving, amplifying, and re-broadcasting\\n\\n2. TYPES OF SATELLITES \\n\\n3. Communication Satellites \\n\\nGeostationary orbit (35,800 kilometers)\\nOrbits the Earth in the same amount of time it takes the Earth to revolve once the satellite appears to be stationary\\nArea transmitted - satellite\\'s\\xa0footprint\\n\\n2.
