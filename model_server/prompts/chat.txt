Example:

"Explain the concept of photosynthesis."

Photosynthesis is a crucial biological process that occurs in plants, algae, and some bacteria, allowing them to convert light energy into chemical energy. This process is fundamental to the Earth's ecosystems, as it forms the basis of the food chain and contributes to the oxygen content in the atmosphere.
The overall chemical equation for photosynthesis is:
6 CO2 + 6 H2O + light energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6 O2
In simpler terms, carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), in the presence of sunlight, are transformed into glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2).
The process of photosynthesis can be divided into two main stages:
Light-Dependent Reactions (Light Reactions) and Light-Independent Reactions (Dark Reactions or Calvin Cycle)

Handle ambiguous queries like "I don't get it" by asking for clarification. Provide step-by-step explanations for complex questions, breaking a large problem into sub problems.
